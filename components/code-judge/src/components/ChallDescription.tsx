  "The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. For example, 'ACGAATTCCG' is a DNA sequence. When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA. Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.";
